# Project Plan

### Name: Syed Malik

### Project Name: `Eureka!`

<br>

## Summary

---

Creating a full stack capstone project that utilizes Visual Studio IDE (backend) and Visual Studio Code (frontend). The backend of the project will be used to create an a Web API using ASP.NET Core (C#) taking advantage of Entity Framework. The frontend of the project will utilize the React.js library, pull the API and display the content as intended. Keeping the two parts (API and React.js) of the projects decoupled. The backend will be the MVP (main focus) and the frontend will be the additional features that is addeded on to the project.

The Application `Eureka!` will be a site where we can go to find solutions to simple problems we all run into in our daily lives when we forget the steps because we don't use it often enough or general helpful steps to a problem. The information will be divided into cards with details about the specific topic. Examples: How to take a screenshot in Windows 10? How do you clear cache in Edge? Ways to avoid procrastination? How to create a database in SQL Server? How to create a chart in Excel?

The information will be provided in a catalog card format. This will make it easier to absorb it's content with not too many details. The idea is to provide useful information in as few words as possible with images if necessary.
